> ##### &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you are viewing this theme, I am glad that your here reading this. Currently this theme is under rapid development. If you check the changelog you will see lots of activity. I probably shouldn't have published it when I did, but its a done deal now, and for the most part, the theme is ready to use. I plan on posting an image for every language I custom highlight below. It is currently <strong><em>(2021-11-28)</em></strong> just to give you a time frame, if you do decide to view the `CHANGELOG` do view the <em><strong>CHANGELOG</strong></em></p>

## ABOUT:

##### _Developer's Dojo_ is based on the theory that highlighting a documents syntax in such a way that is consistent across the entire theme, and with colors that work with each other, will greatly improve readability. To help explain my point, take a look at the image below. The image has 4 lines of code in it. What line, or lines, is the most readable to you?

<br>

##### __HINT:__ _"This is an arbitrary exercise, no right or wrong answer exist."_

I asked this to as many people as I could, which unfortunately was not as many as I would of liked, but twitter did help. And all though the results are far from being _'real-science-quality'_ they do point at a trend. Most people felt that the last _foobar_
variable the most readable line of code, two people said that none of them were less or more readable, but that 4 was the most appealing to look at. A few people, including myself thought that the first string was the most readable. As I hinted in the start of the exercise, the results are arbitrary, if you like pink, and feel pink was more readable, then for you, that is true. 

I interpreted the data as meaning, colors that or closer together on the color spectrum make for a more readable line of code, and I personally believe that this concept scales to the size of the entire document, _so in-other-words;_ when a document is full of bright differentiating colors, the document is actually hindering readability more than it is helping it. A theme has more important purposes than readability — like being able to quickly scan a document for the parameter, or class-member you are working with (thats just one case many others exist) — but readability is what causes me problems when I work, as the longer the day goes the worst my eyesight gets, and I have better than 20/20, but I also spend 16-20 hours at a clip on the computer. Anyhow, if you look at the palette in the image above, you'll see that there is a range of colors, so its possible to separate the different syntaxes within a given programming/markup language, however the colors I choose flow, one into the next, and I even tried to make the groups meet.
