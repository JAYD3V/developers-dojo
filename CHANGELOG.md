# CHANGELOG: Developers Dojo

## UNPUBLISHED:

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This is an area where the 'Project Developer(s)' can list the changes that they
 have made, but have not published publicly yet.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [v0.1.2] - 2021-11-28

<br>

### FIXED:
1. Fixed the terminal so its not so dark. v0.1.1 set it at a pure black, which was a mistake. This version fixes that.
2. Fixed the _`editorGroupHeader.border`_ property so that the area above it looks as if it sits above the text editor, as it is suppose to look.
3. Fixed _`editorGroupHeader.tabsBorder`_ property so that it isn't so saturated. Borders should not pop-out at the user as the _header-tabsBorder_ was.
4. Fixed the color of the `panelTitle.activeBorder` so that it isn't as saturated.

### CHANGED:
1. Changed the background color of the editor's panels, inactive-tabs, and the activitybar. The color is similar, a little less blue, it appears more black, and is lighter than the previous color, which also appeared to be almost black, but defiantly had more of a blue tone and was darker.
2. Changed the color of the `panelTitle.inactiveForeground` from a pastel dark green to a semi-visible grey
3. Changed the color of the `panelTitle.activeForeground` from a very saturated green, to a saturated white.

<br>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [v0.1.1] - 2021-11-27

<br>

### CHANGED:
1. Changed the color of the terminal to be darker
2. Changed the ASNI Colors of the terminal to be more saturated, and to contrast better

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [v0.1.0] - 2021-11-27

<br>

### ADDED:
1. Markdown syntax highlighting.
2. Changed the terminal border so it is no longer red.
3. Bumped the version to v0.1.0, since the first publication was a flop.
4. Changed Snippet/Emmet highlight BG so that its semi-transparent, and black.

### FIXED:
1. Rewrote the README.md document in a way that's supported by _V.S. Code's_ extension\
preview (I had HTML tags in the _`README.md`_ file that the extension readme preview did\
not support).
2. Fixed Snippet/Emmet highlighting background-color. Before the change, any text\
auto-inserted by a snippet &/or emmet was not visible as the highlighting-bg was\
the same color as the text. **_(SEE #4 in ADDED above)_**

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [v0.0.3] - 2021-11-27

<br>

### REMOVED:
- Unpublished Extension v0.0.2: `v0.0.2`** had an incorrect filename, as a
result, when users attempted to to equip ***`Developer's Dojo`***, the theme
caused an error, and failed to render.

### FIXED:

- Corrected _`package.json`_

<br>

## [v0.0.2] - 2021-11-26
