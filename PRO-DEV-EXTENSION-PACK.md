# **VSCODE EXTENSION PRO PACK**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Extension pack has been developed to be a great set of tools to simply make the already awesome VS Code Development Environment that much better. It does have another purpose though. I wrote 5 extensions, and have bundled them into a single extension. Obviously this is much more convenient for those who use the extension, but I am trying to make a point. Its not necessary to modularize extensions. I am not saying that its not beneficial, it can be, but the reality is, usually, its not beneficial, usually its a pain in the ass, and creates a pile of extensions that often gets so large, its difficult for developers to remember what extensions they have, what all the extensions do, and which ones they even need. It also creates a polluted software-marketplace.

## **Conf Assistant**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Conf Assistant aims to shorten its users workload, while saving them valuable time, by solving a very common problem: Shortening the time it takes to configure a project, and the tools that make up the projects environment. First of all, Conf Assist saves & backs up configuration files, and organizes them for you. It implements a hassle-free interface that gives its user the ability to generate their saved, synchronized, and organized configuration files right into whatever project they have open, at any given time, in VS Code.

##### CONF ASSIST PREFORMS THE FOLLOWING

1. Saves, Backs-up, & synchronizes
2. Supports Creating & Storing multiple versions of the same configuration file.
3. Generates your predefined configuration templates right into your projects root.

There is also a CLI under development that can be coupled with the extension.

## **Mechanical Comments**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mechanical Comments came to be the name of the Extension because it describes what the extension does: Turns comments into a Tool that can has tooling aspects to them. This extension totally changes the way that comments are used. The can annotate.
